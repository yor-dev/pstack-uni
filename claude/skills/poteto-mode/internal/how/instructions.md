# How

Explore the codebase to answer "how does X work?" questions. Produce architectural explanations at the level of a senior engineer onboarding onto a subsystem, enough to build a working mental model, not so much that it reads like annotated source code.

Each subagent role below names a line in the pstack model configuration section of the project-root `AGENTS.md` and a default. Use that line's `{model, effort}`, or the default if the line is missing. `auto` and `inherit-parent` mean the parent model and effort. If a configured model is unavailable, use the role's default and say so. If that default is also unavailable, use the closest available model in the same family. If none exists, ask the user to choose an available model.

## Step 1. Assess Complexity

If the scope is ambiguous, state your interpretation and explore. The user can redirect.

- **Simple** (a single module, a small utility, a narrow question such as "how does function X work"): no explorers. One explainer explores and explains in a single pass. Go to Step 2b.
- **Complex** (a subsystem spanning multiple files or services, a cross-cutting feature, a full architectural overview): spawn parallel explorers first, then hand off to the explainer. Go to Step 2a.

When in doubt, take the simple path.

## Step 2a. Explore (complex questions only)

Decompose the question into 2 to 4 exploration angles, each a distinct slice of the subsystem. Spawn all explorers concurrently using the `how explorer` role line, default `grok-4.7-xhigh-fast`.

Each explorer gets the prompt in `references/explorer-prompt.md` with its angle filled in. Then go to Step 3.

## Step 2b. Direct Explain (simple questions)

Spawn one subagent that explores and explains in one pass using the `how explainer` role line, default `claude-opus-5-5-max`.

Build its prompt from `references/explainer-prompt.md` without the explorer-findings section. Go to Step 4.

## Step 3. Synthesize (complex questions only)

Once all explorers have returned, spawn one subagent to synthesize their findings using the `how explainer` role line, default `claude-opus-5-5-max`.

Build its prompt from `references/explainer-prompt.md` with every explorer's findings filled in.

## Step 4. Present

Present the explainer's output to the user. Light edits for clarity or context from the conversation are fine. Do not substantially rewrite it.

## Output Format

The explanation uses the sections defined in `references/explainer-prompt.md`, dropping any that do not apply: Overview, Key Concepts, How It Works, Where Things Live, Gotchas.
